# Step-by-Step “Scraping” / “Extraction” Plan

Below is a **step-by-step “scraping” / “extraction” plan** that outlines how to gather trending hashtags, topics, and potentially relevant content creators from various platforms. **No code** is included—this is purely a reference outline.

## 1. Decide on Platforms and Key Data

1. **Identify Priority Platforms**  
   - Examples: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Google Trends.  
   - Choose at least one to start with and add more over time.

2. **Clarify Data Points**  
   - **Hashtags or Topics** (e.g., #danceChallenge, #AIArt).  
   - **Popularity Metrics** (e.g., view counts, like counts, “trend scores”).  
   - **Content Creator Info** (if needed: usernames, follower counts).  
   - **Timestamps** of data collection for historical tracking.

3. **Establish Data Storage**  
   - Decide on a simple approach first (e.g., storing as JSON files).  
   - Consider a database later if needed for larger-scale or more frequent scraping.

## 2. Plan the Scraping Method for Each Platform

1. **TikTok**  
   - Determine if you’ll use a web interface (e.g., trending page) or a third-party aggregator.  
   - Consider whether you need a headless browser approach for dynamic content.  
   - Decide how to capture: trending hashtags, popular creators, engagement metrics (views, likes).

2. **Instagram Reels**  
   - Understand that login might be required for full data access.  
   - Decide if you’ll scrape the Reels “Explore” section or if you’ll use a third-party analytics platform.  
   - Outline what data matters (hashtags, creator handles, basic performance metrics).

3. **YouTube Shorts**  
   - Evaluate using the YouTube Data API or partial web scraping of trending pages.  
   - Identify relevant search parameters to isolate short-form videos.  
   - Define data points: video title, channel name, view counts (if available).

4. **Google Trends**  
   - Consider using a library or service that exposes trending queries.  
   - Determine if you’ll track general topics (e.g., “celebrity news,” “dance challenges”) or specific hashtags.  
   - Plan how frequently you’ll poll Google Trends (e.g., daily, weekly).

## 3. Develop an Extraction Workflow

1. **Sequential vs. Parallel**  
   - Decide if you want to scrape each platform in sequence or in parallel.  
   - A typical flow might be: start with TikTok → proceed to Instagram → then YouTube Shorts → finally Google Trends.

2. **Normalization of Data**  
   - Plan how you’ll standardize results across platforms:  
     - A shared field for `platform` (e.g., `tiktok`, `instagram`, `youtube`).  
     - A shared or comparable popularity metric.  
     - A consistent timestamp (UTC).

3. **Deduplication**  
   - Decide how to handle repeated hashtags or topics found on multiple platforms.  
   - Possibly aggregate popularity metrics for duplicates.

## 4. Logging and Error Handling Approach

1. **Logging**  
   - Record when each platform scrape starts and ends.  
   - Store details about how many items were successfully extracted.  
   - Keep logs separated by platform for easier debugging.

2. **Error Handling**  
   - Decide on a retry strategy if a platform load fails or blocks your requests.  
   - Introduce wait times or IP rotation if needed to avoid rate limits.

3. **Monitoring**  
   - Use a simple notification (email or chat alert) if a scrape step fails.  
   - Track changes in site layout or platform API updates that could break your extraction routines.

## 5. Scheduling Strategy

1. **Frequency of Scraping**  
   - Determine how often each platform should be scraped (daily, weekly, etc.).  
   - Consider each platform’s pace of new trending content.

2. **Scheduler Choice**  
   - Use a cron job (Linux/macOS), Windows Task Scheduler, or a pipeline tool like Airflow/Jenkins.  
   - Coordinate scraping tasks to avoid overlapping if resources are limited.

3. **Coordination**  
   - If concurrency is needed, ensure each task can run independently.  
   - If not, schedule them sequentially to simplify resource usage.

## 6. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

1. **Single-Platform Prototype**  
   - Choose one platform to start with (e.g., YouTube Shorts).  
   - Validate the process of extraction, storage, and logging.

2. **Validation**  
   - Check if the scraped data matches expectations for “trending.”  
   - Confirm relevant fields are captured (e.g., popularity, timestamp).

3. **Expansion**  
   - Add more platforms (TikTok, Instagram, Google Trends) once the MVP is stable.  
   - Maintain a modular approach so each scraper can be enabled or disabled independently.

---

## 7. Next Steps After Extraction

1. **Data Analysis**  
   - Define how you’ll rank or filter hashtags based on metrics (e.g., view counts).  
   - Decide how to feed top trends into your subsequent content pipeline.

2. **Integration into Larger Workflow**  
   - Your goal may be to feed prompts for AI image generation or identify videos to re-post.  
   - Link these scraped results to your content creation steps.

3. **Ongoing Maintenance**  
   - Review scraping methods periodically to address site layout or API changes.  
   - Monitor logs to detect issues early.

## Summary

1. **Step 1**: Decide which platforms to scrape and what specific data you need.  
2. **Step 2**: Plan a method for each platform (web scraping vs. official API).  
3. **Step 3**: Determine a unified data model (consistent fields, timestamps, etc.).  
4. **Step 4**: Establish logging and error-handling to manage issues.  
5. **Step 5**: Choose a scheduling approach (cron, Task Scheduler, or a CI/CD system).  
6. **Step 6**: Build an MVP with one platform and expand incrementally.  
7. **Step 7**: Integrate with your bigger content pipeline, focusing on ranking and filtering to identify top trends.

Use this outline as a reference to guide your scraping setup, ensuring a smooth start and an adaptable process for adding more platforms in the future.
